import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

YAPL is a markdown-first, composable templating language for AI agents. Define **blocks**, reuse with **mixins**, and inject **variables** to create dynamic, maintainable prompts that scale.

## Why YAPL?

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Template Inheritance" icon="puzzle">
		Build complex prompts by extending base templates, just like in web frameworks. Define common structures once and customize them for specific use cases.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Mixins & Composition" icon="add-document">
		Compose prompts from reusable components. Mix and match different behaviors, tones, and capabilities without duplication.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Dynamic Variables" icon="setting">
		Use variables with default values to create flexible prompts that adapt to different contexts and requirements.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Conditional Logic" icon="laptop">
		Include or exclude content based on conditions, creating prompts that adapt to user types, difficulty levels, or specific scenarios.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Quick Example

```yapl title="agent-template.md.yapl"
{% extends "base/system.md" %}
{% mixin "mixins/friendly.md" %}

{% block persona %}
{{ super() }}
You are {{ agent_type | default("a helpful assistant") }} specializing in {{ domain }}.
{% endblock %}

{% block guidance %}
{{ super() }}
{% if user_level == "beginner" %}
Use simple language and provide step-by-step explanations.
{% else %}
You can use technical terminology and advanced concepts.
{% endif %}
{% endblock %}
```

:::note[Syntax Highlighting]
YAPL uses a Twig-like syntax with `{{ }}` for variables and `{% %}` for directives. The syntax highlighting above shows YAPL-specific tokens in the brand pink color scheme.
:::

This creates a flexible AI agent prompt that inherits from a base system template, adds friendly behavior through a mixin, and adapts its communication style based on the user's experience level.
