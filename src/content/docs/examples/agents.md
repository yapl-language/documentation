## Key Patterns Demonstrated

These examples showcase several important patterns:

1. **Modular Architecture**: Using base templates with mixins for different capabilities
2. **Context Adaptation**: Agents that change behavior based on user context
3. **Hierarchical Specialization**: Building from general to specific agent types
4. **Configuration-Driven Behavior**: Using variables to customize agent responses
5. **Template Composition**: Combining multiple mixins for complex behaviors
6. **Structured Workflows**: Defining clear processes and procedures
7. **Resource Integration**: Including external resources and tools
8. **Progressive Disclosure**: Showing information based on context and need

These patterns can be adapted and combined to create sophisticated AI agents for any domain or use case.
